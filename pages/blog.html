          <h2>Practicing mindfulness</h2>
          <p>Let me preface by saying I am no expert in the field of psychology. I am however a human being with emotions, struggles and times that have been tough. 3 ways I practice mindfulness daily are:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Find your routine</li>
            <p>Do you find yourself going to bed at different times each night? Maybe you stay up way too late using your phone in bed? Try setting reminders for when you want to go to bed and start winding down. Try switching your phone out for a book or a short, silent meditation.</p>
            <li>Breath</li>
            <p>No, Seriously! I know, I know, thats what everyone says and it can be easier said than done. Start by closing your eyes in a comfortable, semi quiet space, wherever that may be. Take a few deep breaths and let them fill your belly. While doing this, try to think only of what your body is feeling currently. This can be a good time to take note of any discomforts you may be having. Focus on the feeling of the air filling your lungs, the feeling of any breeze wherever you are, the spot in which your body contacts the chair, floor or wherever you may be sitting.</p>
